h1. has_breadcrumbs

has_breadcrumbs is a simple plugin that adds a breadcrumb object into controllers and views.

h2. Instalation

You can install using as gem:

<pre>
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  config.gem 'has_breadcrumbs'
end
</pre>

or install as plugin with `script/plugin install git://github.com/sobrinho/has_breadcrumbs.git`

h2. Usage

On your controller:

<pre>
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_filter :add_initial_breadcrumb

  protected

  def add_initial_breadcrumb
    breadcrumb.add 'Home', root_path
  end
end

class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    # you can also use << instead of add
    breadcrumb.add 'Posts', posts_path
  end
end
</pre>

You don't need to provide an URL; in that case, a span will be generated
instead of a link:

<pre>
breadcrumb.add 'Some page'
</pre>

You can set additional HTML attributes if you need to:

<pre>
breadcrumb.add 'Home', root_path, :id => 'home', :title => 'Go to the home page'
</pre>

On your view:

<pre>You are here: <%= breadcrumb.display %></pre>

The output in your html will be something like below:

<pre>
  <ul id="breadcrumbs">
    <li class="item-0"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li class="item-1"><a href="#">Main section</a></li>
    <li class="item-2"><a href="#">Sub section</a></li>
    <li class="item-3 last">The page you are on right now</li>
  </ul>
</pre>

For a good css example take a look in examples folder.
